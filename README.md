## Note: This is a fork of the [original VSLilyPond extension](https://github.com/lhl2617/VSLilyPond).

### Changes

- Fixes [reload on create](https://github.com/lhl2617/VSLilyPond-PDF-preview/pull/118)
  - This is fixed in [VSLilyPond-PDF-preview](https://github.com/mwojick/VSLilyPond-PDF-preview) (also forked)
- Fixes [formatting on save issue](https://github.com/lhl2617/VSLilyPond-formatter/issues/308) by removing the dependency on the formatter for now and using a different setup (see [Setup formatting](#setup-formatting)).
  - I've also forked [the formatter](https://github.com/mwojick/VSLilyPond-formatter) so maybe I'll fix it there at some point, but this works for now.
- Cleans up temporary pdf and .ly~ files when intellisense runs.

### Installing the forks

Since the forks are not yet published on the VSCode marketplace, for now you can install them manually:

> **Note:** you may have to uninstall the original extensions first.

Clone the repos:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mwojick/VSLilyPond.git
git clone git@github.com:mwojick/VSLilyPond-PDF-preview.git
```

Install each extension in their respective directories (must have `npm` and `vsce` installed):

```bash
npm install
vsce package
code --install-extension *.vsix
```

> **Note:** change `code` to `cursor` or some other vscode fork if you are using that instead.

### Setup formatting

Install [run on save](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave)

Install [python-ly](https://pypi.org/project/python-ly/):

```bash
pip install python-ly
```

Add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
  "[lilypond]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": false
  },
  "emeraldwalk.runonsave": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "match": "\\.ly$",
        "cmd": "ly reformat -i ${file}"
      }
    ]
  },
```
